## Introduction

Agents operating without prior data face the fundamental challenge of exploration vs exploitation. This document provides a comprehensive overview of different approaches agents can use to take actions when starting from scratch, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

### Key Challenges
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balancing discovery of new strategies with optimization of known ones
- **Sample Efficiency**: Learning effectively with limited experience
- **Scalability**: Handling high-dimensional state and action spaces
- **Convergence**: Ensuring learning algorithms reach optimal or near-optimal policies

---

## Model-Free Methods

### Q-Learning
**Principle**: Direct learning of action-value function Q(s,a) from experience

**Algorithm**:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

**Advantages**:
- No environment model required
- Converges to optimal policy under certain conditions
- Simple to implement

**Disadvantages**:
- Can be sample inefficient
- May converge slowly in large state spaces

### SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
**Principle**: On-policy temporal difference learning

**Algorithm**:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

**Key Difference**: Uses actual next action a' instead of maximum over all actions

### Actor-Critic Methods
**Principle**: Combines policy gradient (Actor) with value function (Critic)

**Components**:
- **Actor**: Learns policy π(s) → a
- **Critic**: Learns value function V(s) or Q(s,a)

**Popular Variants**:
- A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
- A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)

**Advantages**:
- Reduces variance of policy gradients
- Maintains unbiased estimates
- Good for continuous action spaces

## Model-Based Methods

### Dyna-Q
**Principle**: Combines model-free Q-learning with model-based planning

**Algorithm**:
1. Learn environment model from real experience
2. Use model for "mental rehearsal" between real experiences
3. Update Q-values from both real and simulated experience

**Key Insight**: Can learn faster by simulating experiences

**Advantages**:

- World Models

**Advantages**:
- High sample efficiency
- Can plan ahead
- Good for safety-critical applications

## Exploration Strategies

### ε-Greedy
**Principle**: Random exploration with probability ε, greedy selection otherwise

**Algorithm**:
```
if random() < ε:
    action = random_action()
else:
    action = argmax Q(s,a)
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple to implement
- Guaranteed to explore all actions
- Easy to tune

**Disadvantages**:
- Suboptimal exploration
- Does not use uncertainty information

### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
**Principle**: Balances exploration vs exploitation using uncertainty

**Algorithm**:
```
action = argmax Q(s,a) + c√(ln(t)/N(s,a))
```

**Components**:
- Q(s,a): Current value estimate
- N(s,a): Number of times action a taken in state s
- t: Total number of steps
- c: Exploration constant

**Advantages**:
- Automatically reduces exploration over time
- Uses uncertainty information
- Theoretical guarantees

### Thompson Sampling
**Principle**: Bayesian approach to exploration

**Algorithm**:
1. Maintain posterior distribution over action values
2. Sample from posterior for action selection
3. Update posterior based on observed reward

**Advantages**:

## Meta-Learning Approaches

### Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
**Principle**: "Learning to learn" - adapts quickly to new tasks

**Process**:

2. Learn initialization that enables fast adaptation
3. Adapt to new task with few samples

**Advantages**:

θ ← θ + α(θ' - θ)
```

**Advantages**:
- More computationally efficient than MAML
- Still enables fast adaptation
- Simpler implementation

**Advantages**:

- Can transfer knowledge across tasks
- Enables temporal abstraction

### Hierarchical RL
**Principle**: Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks

**Structure**:

- Higher levels guide lower levels

**Advantages**:
- Reduces sample complexity
- Enables complex behavior
- Better generalization

1. Model other agents' behavior
2. Adapt to changing opponent strategies
3. Coordinate actions when beneficial

**Advantages**:
